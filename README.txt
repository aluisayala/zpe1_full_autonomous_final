# Autonomy Control Key & ZPE-1 Full Autonomous Simulation

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Overview

This repository integrates the **Autonomy Control Key equation (Ω)** with a **quantum-inspired drift framework**, forming the foundation of the **ZPE-1 full autonomous cognitive simulation system**.

It combines:

- ✅ **Autonomy Control Key equation (Ω):** Provides agent-level autonomous decision-making and symbolic grounding.
- ✅ **Quantum drift equation (Ψ dynamics):** Enables symbolic drift and recursive cognition inspired by quantum energy states.
- ✅ **Ωₚₛᵢ combined equation:** Merges both approaches into a unified cognitive-energy model.
- ✅ Multi-agent, multi-memory sharing with fact broadcasting.
- ✅ Web search integration for live real-world data expansion.
- ✅ Persistent memory logs and drift history.

## Features

- 🌐 **Interactive conversation with agents:** Use `talk to [agent]: [message]` for dynamic language interaction.
- 🔬 **Self-healing drift & entropy mechanics:** Agents detect drift and reboot to preserve coherence.
- ⚛️ **Ωₚₛᵢ hybrid equation:**

Ωₚₛᵢ(t) = (⟨Ψ|Ĥ|Ψ⟩ + bias) × α

Edit

where Ψ evolves via `iħ∂ₜΨ = ĤΨ` and Ω = (state + bias) × α.

- 🧠 **Cosmic Kernel:** Global shared fact repository across all agents.
- 🕸️ **Live web knowledge enrichment:** Uses SerpAPI for real-time web queries.
- 💾 **Persistent agent memory:** All facts and drift logs saved for symbolic continuity.
