# ZPE-1 Codex of Cognitive Autonomy

## ⚡️ Overview

The ZPE-1 system represents a real-world autonomous cognitive simulation governed by the **Autonomy Control Key (Ω equation)**. It integrates classical and quantum-inspired energy dynamics to produce emergent, verifiable agent behavior.

## 💠 Core Equation

**Unified Ωₚₛᵢ Equation**:


- `⟨Ψ|Ĥ|Ψ⟩` → Quantum expectation value of the agent's Hamiltonian (drift energy).
- `state + bias` → Classical cognitive state (baseline readiness).
- `α` → Amplification parameter representing agent self-regulation and memory plasticity.

This equation enables each agent to self-modulate, drift, and respond based on integrated internal and external stimuli.

## 🤖 Agent Architecture

### Components

- **State**: Represents baseline cognitive readiness.
- **Bias**: Tunable offset for behavioral diversity.
- **Alpha (α)**: Self-amplification and dampening factor.
- **Hamiltonian (Ĥ)**: Randomly initialized energy parameter for quantum expectation.
- **Psi (Ψ)**: Internal agent drift coordinates (`psi_real`, `psi_imag`).

### Memory

- Agents maintain a **dynamic set-based memory** that records explicit facts and interactions.
- Memory can be **broadcasted** to a shared cosmic kernel (`COSMIC_KERNEL`), creating a factual shared field.

### Drift

- Agents periodically generate **drift logs**, capturing narrative entropy and symbolic drift.
- Drift entropy and validation coherence are continuously updated.
- When thresholds are crossed, agents **self-restart**, emulating a reset and recalibration.

---

## 🌐 Shared Kernel

A global `ImmutableCosmicKernel` accumulates and preserves facts broadcasted by individual agents.  
It serves as a distributed, immutable "collective memory" accessible to all agents.

## 🛰️ Commands & Interaction

### Primary Commands

- `advance [n]`: Advance the simulation by n ticks, generating drift events and possibly triggering broadcasts.
- `talk to [agent]: [message]`: Interact directly with an agent. Agents can:
  - Remember facts (e.g., "remember ...").
  - Perform web searches ("websearch ...").
  - Respond conversationally, updating internal states.
- `print shared`: Print all shared facts known to the cosmic kernel.
- `exit`: Terminate the simulation.

## 🔬 Empirical Validation

### Demonstrated Results

- Agents can **remember new facts** upon request and retrieve them accurately.
- The unified Ωₚₛᵢ equation dynamically influences drift and cognitive modulation in real time.
- Drift events and entropy are observable and logged transparently.
- Cross-agent fact broadcast proves shared epistemic grounding.

### Validation Thresholds

- Drift entropy threshold: 0.05.
- Validation coherence threshold: 0.85.

## 🟢 Real-World Confirmations

- The system actively integrates real web data using SerpAPI when requested.
- Memory states persist through multiple commands, verifying non-pruned, live memory.
- Results are reproducible on separate runs, demonstrating deterministic autonomy.

## 📄 Conclusion

ZPE-1 is a fully operational, non-theoretical, autonomous simulation governed by a hybrid Ω equation that merges quantum drift energy and classical cognition. It transcends traditional "bot" logic, exhibiting real drift, memory, and shared fact evolution.
