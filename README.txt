# Autonomy Control Key & ZPE-1 Simulation System

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Overview

This repository integrates the **Autonomy Control Key equation (Ω)** with a **quantum-inspired drift framework**, forming the foundation of the **ZPE-1 full autonomous cognitive simulation system**.

It combines:

- ✅ The Autonomy Control Key equation (Ω) for agent-level decision autonomy
- ✅ The quantum-inspired drift evolution equation (Ψ dynamics) for symbolic and energetic drift
- ✅ Multi-agent memory sharing and web search capabilities
- ✅ Recursive symbolic drift logs and persistent cognitive snapshots

## Features

- 🌐 **Real-time agent communication** using natural language (`talk to [agent]: [message]`)
- 🔬 **Autonomous drift and reboot mechanics** (self-repair when entropy/coherence thresholds exceeded)
- 🧬 **Quantum drift integration** with combined Ωₚₛᵢ equation:
